		\item Social Learning: reshape the reward function of other agents with the goal of promoting cooperation
		\item Gifting: peer-rewarding strategy in which agents can reward others with a new specialized action
		\item Gifting mechanisms: each time an agent sends a gift $g$, its gifting budget is decremented by $g$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Zero-Sum: the budget is infinite, but the agent incurs a penalty $-g$ for every gifting action taken
			\item Fixed Budget: the budget is fixed at the start of the episode and when it's empty no more gifting can happen
			\item Replenishable Budget: the budget expands as a function of collected environmental rewards
